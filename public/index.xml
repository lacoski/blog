      <description>Not a generic list of programming mistakes, these are the lessons I wish I learned earlier while developing Go. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past two years developing some of the most popular libraries and applications written in Go. I&amp;rsquo;ve also made a lot of mistakes along the way. Recognizing that &amp;ldquo;The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. -John Powell&amp;rdquo;, I would like to share with you the mistakes that I have made over my journey with Go and when you can avoid them.</description>

Nitro is a quick and easy performance analyzer library for golang.
It is useful for comparing A/B against different drafts of functions
or different functions. Building on the standard pprof library, Nitro
provides a very high level view of your application performance to help
identify areas to investigate further. It also provides an easy metric
to compare as you revise and improve each part of your application.
